  <h2>Short Bio</h2>
    <p>I am originally from a small town called Paradise, CA. In my spare time, I go on adventures with my girlfriend all over the Pacific Northwest.<br> I was in the Navy for 4 years. And I worked at Dunn Lumber here in Seattle for a few months before deciding to join Code Fellows.
